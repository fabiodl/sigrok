.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B sigrok\-cli
is a cross-platform command line utility for the
.B sigrok
logic analyzer software.
.PP
The command-line frontend for sigrok cannot display graphical output, but is
still sufficient to run through the whole process of hardware initialization,
acquisition, protocol analysis and saving the session.
.PP
It is useful for running on remote or embedded systems, netbooks, PDAs,
and for various other use-cases. It can display samples on standard output or
save them in various file formats.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Show a help text and exit.
.TP
.B "\-V, \-\-version"
Show
.B sigrok-cli
version, and information about supported hardware drivers, input file
formats, output file formats, and protocol decoders.
.TP
.B "\-D, \-\-list\-devices"
List all logic analyzer devices found on the system. This actively scans for
devices (USB, serial port, and others).
.TP
.BR "\-i, \-\-input\-file " <filename>
Load input from a file instead of a hardware device. If the
.B \-\-input\-format
option is not supplied, sigrok-cli attempts to autodetect the file format of
the input file.
.TP
.BR "\-I, \-\-input\-format " <format>
When loading an input file, assume it's in the specified format. If this
option is not supplied (in addition to
.BR \-\-input\-file ),
sigrok-cli attempts to autodetect the file format of the input file.
.TP
.BR "\-o, \-\-output\-file " <filename>
Save output to a file instead of writing it to stdout. The default format
used when saving is the sigrok session file format. This can be changed with
the
.B \-\-output\-format
option.
.TP
.BR "\-O, \-\-output\-format " <formatname>
Set the output format to use. Use the
.B \-V
option to see a list of available output formats. The format name may
optionally be followed by a colon-separated list of options, where each
option takes the form
.BR "key=value" .
.sp
Supported formats currently include
.BR bits ,
.BR hex ,
.BR ascii ,
.BR binary ,
.BR vcd ,
.BR ols ", and"
.BR gnuplot .
.sp
The
.B bits
or
.B hex
formats, for an ASCII bit or ASCII hexadecimal display, can take a "width" option, specifying the number of samples (in bits) to display per line. Thus
.B hex:width=128
will display 128 bits per line, in hexadecimal:
.sp
 1:ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
 2:ff00 ff00 ff00 ff00 ff00 ff00 ff00 ff00
.sp
The lines always start with the probe number (or name, if defined), followed by a colon. If no format is specified, it defaults to
.BR bits:width=64 ,
like this:
.sp
 1:11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 [...]
 2:11111111 00000000 11111111 00000000 [...]
.TP
.BR "\-d, \-\-device " <device>
The device to use for acquisition. It can be specified by ID as reported by
.BR "\-\-list\-devices" ,
or by the name of the driver as reported by
.BR \-\-version .
.sp
A device can optionally be followed by a colon-separated list of device
options, where each option takes the form
.BR key=value .
For example, to set the samplerate on the first device you might specify
.sp
.RB "  $ " "sigrok\-cli \-d 0:samplerate=1m"
.sp
Samplerate is an option common to most devices. The argument specifies the
samplerate in Hz. You can also specify the samplerate in kHz, MHz or GHz.
The following are all equivalent:
.sp
.RB "  $ " "sigrok\-cli \-\-samples 100 \-d 0:samplerate=1000000"
.sp
.RB "  $ " "sigrok\-cli \-\-samples 100 \-d 0:samplerate=1m"
.sp
.RB "  $ " "sigrok\-cli \-\-samples 100 \-d ""0:samplerate=1 MHz""
.TP
.BR "\-p, \-\-probes " <probelist>
A comma-separated list of probes to be used in the session.
.sp
The default is to use all the probes available on a device. You can name
a probe like this:
.BR "1=CLK" .
A range of probes can also be given, in the form
.BR "1\-5" .
.sp
Example:
.sp
 $
.B "sigrok\-cli \-\-samples 100 \-\-probes 1=CLK,2\-4,7"
.br
 CLK:11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 [...]
   2:11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 [...]
   3:11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 [...]
   4:11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 [...]
   7:11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 [...]
.sp
The comma-separated list is processed from left to right, i.e. items farther
to the right override previous items. For example
.B "1=CS,1=MISO"
will set the name of probe 1 to
.BR "MISO" .
.sp
Also, while
.B "5=MOSI,6=MISO"
will only select probes 5 and 6, and set their names to MISO and MOSI, the
command line
.B "5=MOSI,6=MISO,1\-8"
will select probes 1\-8 (including 5 and 6, of course), but the names specified
for probes 5 and 6 will be reset to the defaults by the
.B "1\-8"
probe selection.
.TP
.BR "\-t, \-\-triggers " <triggerlist>
A comma-separated list of triggers to use, of the form
.BR "<probe>=<trigger>" .
You can use the name or number of the probe, and the trigger itself is a
series of characters:
.sp
.BR "0 or 1" :
A low or high value on the pin.
.br
.BR "r or f" :
A rising or falling value on the pin. An
.B r
effectively corresponds to
.BR 01 .
.br
.BR "c" :
Any kind of change on a pin.
.sp
Not every device supports all of these trigger types. Use the
.B "\-d <device>"
argument (with no other arguments) to see which triggers your device supports.
.TP
.BR "\-w, \-\-wait-trigger"
Don't output any sample data (even if it's actually received from the logic
analyzer) before the trigger condition is met. In other words, do not output
any pre-trigger data. This option is useful if you don't care about the data
that came before the trigger (but the logic analyzer hardware delivers this
data to sigrok nonetheless).
.TP
.BR "\-\-time " <ms>
Sample for
.B <ms>
milliseconds, then quit. You can optionally follow the number by
.B s
to state the number of seconds to sample instead. For example,
.B "\-\-time 2s"
will sample for two seconds.
.TP
.BR "\-\-samples " <numsamples>
Acquire
.B <numsamples>
samples, then quit.
.TP
.BR "\-\-continuous"
Sample continuously until stopped. Not all devices support this.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
In order to get exactly 100 samples from the (only) detected logic analyzer
hardware, run the following command:
.TP
.B "  sigrok\-cli \-\-samples 100"
.TP
If you want to sample data for 3 seconds, use:
.TP
.B "  sigrok\-cli \-\-time 3000"
.TP
Alternatively, you can also use:
.TP
.B "  sigrok\-cli \-\-time 3s"
.TP
To capture data from 4 probes lasting 100ms at 10 MHz starting at the trigger condition 1:high, 2:rising, 3:low, 4:high, use:
.TP
.B "  sigrok\-cli \-O bits \-p 1\-4 \-\-time 100 \-o samplerate=10m \\\\"
.B "      \-\-wait\-trigger \-\-triggers 1=1,2=r,3=0,4=1 "
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.B sigrok\-cli
exits with 0 on success, 1 on most failures.
